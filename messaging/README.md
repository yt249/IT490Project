### RabbitMQ Management Interface

To use the RabbitMQ management interface to check to see if queues are being created, you have to go to
http://localhost:15672/ and see the management interface running. After signing in with a valid name and password you would see the overview page. 
This overview shows two charts. One for queued messages and one with the message rate. It is here that one would see the changes as queues are being created. One can also check the queue page that lists all queues.
